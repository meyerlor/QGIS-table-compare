description=Visual comparison tool for vector layers and tables with change detection, filtering, and export capabilities
about=Table Compare is a powerful plugin that enables visual comparison of two vector layers or tables with similar structures. Perfect for version control, data auditing, and change detection workflows. Features include color-coded difference visualization (Added/Deleted/Modified/Unchanged), field-level change tracking with old→new value display, flexible filtering options, accept/reject workflow for changes, smart column selection to ignore system fields, CSV export with decision tracking, custom join field selection, and sortable results with dynamic row numbering. Ideal for GIS analysts, data managers, quality assurance teams, and collaborative mapping projects requiring change documentation and approval workflows.
